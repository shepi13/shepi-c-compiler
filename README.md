# Simple C Compiler written in Rust.

![Build Status](https://github.com/shepi13/shepi-c-compiler/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?event=push)
-------

### Still in development, and mainly just a personal project to learn rust and compiler design.

Currently supports:

- Variables
- Loops
- Functions
- If, Conditionals, and Switch Statements
- Arithmetic/Relational/Bitwise Operators (with short circuting && and || as well as precedence climbing)
- static/extern
- signed/unsigned int/long types with proper C conversions and casting
