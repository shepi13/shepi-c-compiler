# Simple C Compiler written in Rust.

![Build Status](https://github.com/shepi13/shepi-c-compiler/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?event=push)
-------

### Still in development, and mainly just a personal project to learn rust and compiler design.

Currently supports:

- Variables
- Loops
- Functions
- If, Conditionals, and Switch Statements
- Gotos and Labels
- Arithmetic/Relational/Bitwise Operators (with short circuting && and || as well as precedence climbing)
- Compound assignment, Increment and Decrement operators
- Static and Extern variables
- Signed/Unsigned integer types with proper C conversions and casting, including long/long long
- Double Precision floating point operations
----------------
In progress:
- Structs/Unions
- Pointers/Arrays (including cstrings)
- Dynamic memory allocation
- const / enum

- Optimizations
